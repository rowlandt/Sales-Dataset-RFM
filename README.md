# Sales Dataset RFM

The first part of the analysis we examine the data to extract insight from customers' past purchase behaivor. Starting with analyzing sales revenue using SQL queries such as aggregate, subqueries, CTEs, and Window functions; and generated a customer segmentation analysis using Recency-Frequency-Monetary(RFM) technique to identify groups of customers for marketing. The visualizations used were made with Tableau.

2. Which year sold the most? Digging further to understand the dramatic dip in revenue in 2005 uncovered that there was only data for the months of January to May. From the graph we can see that revenue was increasing each year and can deduce if there was more data that 2005 would possibly be the best year.
